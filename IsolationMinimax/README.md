Pull the project.
Run the project. A main menu will pop up, for you to play, click the Player vs AI.
For simplicity sake, player vs AI will only use heuristic 1. 
The game plays exactly like the board game, the game will prevent your move if it's bad or not your turn.
Play until the game is complete, you can restart, quit or go back to the main menu.
